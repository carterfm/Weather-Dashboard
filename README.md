# Weather-Dashboard
An app that allows users to search cities and view their five-day forecasts. Draws heavily on data from the OpenWeather One Call API. Includes current date at user's location, current weather, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and UV index, and the forecasted weather, temperature, wind speed, and humidity over the next five days at the same hour the user made the weather query. The UV index display is color-coded based on its severity.
